<p>365 days and 13 hours ago I said " yes". Little did I know then that I would want this yes to stay forever. But eventually it happened n all because of you. I can't even express the amount of happiness and how blessed I feel to have you in my life.
For someone like me who has always wanted a fairytale love, to have actually found my knight and shining armour, the prince charming I have always dreamt of is the most precious gift I possess. YOU are the most precious gift that I have and don't ever want to lose at any cost.</p>

<p>That smile of yours takes away all my worries and those twinkling eyes while you smile brightens my day. You rubbing your nose on mine is the cutest gesture ever made and that kiss on my forehead makes me feel worth living.
                                          I feel like pulling those cute cheeks and nibbling those ears whenever I see them. 
                                          The warm hugs when you wrap me up with those strong shoulders takes me to my safest place where I just want to fall asleep to the sound of your heartbeat.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for being in my life. For making me feel loved and wanted. For filling my days with bliss and care. For being my peace my pride my strength and my charm. Thank you for all these sweetest 365 days our little infinity ∞</p>
